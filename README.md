## Requirements

**Note:** This should only be run on after the first pull.

If the user does not have yarn as a dependency manager, you can install it using:

`npm install --global yarn`

After installing yarn, run the following script to ensure that yarn was installed properly:

`yarn --version`

When yarn is properly installed, run the following script in the directory to ensure all dependencies are installed for the project:

`yarn install`

## Progress and Goals for the Semester

These are our [Progress and Goals](ProgressAndGoals.md) for the semester.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn lint`

Runs a linting program on the directory to ensure that code is uniform and organized.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!
