        About the Journal
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The <strong>MCJES Journal</strong> is a peer-reviewed publication
        dedicated to advancing the study of insects and their impact on
        ecological, agricultural, medical, and social systems. Our journal
        serves as a platform for entomologists, researchers, and students to
        share innovative findings, theoretical insights, and practical
        applications related to the world of insects.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        We publish original research articles, literature reviews, field
        observations, and manuscripts that explore all aspects of
        entomologyâ€”including insect behavior, biodiversity, taxonomy,
        conservation, pest management, vector biology, and insect-human
        interactions.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        MCJES is committed to fostering an inclusive and accessible scientific
        community. We welcome submissions from early-career researchers,
        graduate students, and professionals working across disciplines
        connected to insect science.
