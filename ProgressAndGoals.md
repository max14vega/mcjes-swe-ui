# Goals for the Semester

This is a link to the [User Requirements Guide](https://github.com/gcallah/SoftwareEngineering/blob/master/docs/user_reqs_spring_2025.md) of the Journal. 

## Goal 1: Include the following pages:

In this journal, there are multiple pages/modals that the user will see. These are pages that have been deemed necessary for a good user experience.

- **A Masthead Page.** This should include the title of the website, mission statements, call to actions (CTAs), and possibly include a to-do page.
- **An About Page.** This should include what the software is for, the creators of the website and other relevant information.
- **A Submissions Guidelines Page.** This should let the user know what they are allowed to submit and what needs to be included.
- **WIP:** More pages will be added

## Goal 2: Include the following:

| People          | Text           | Manuscripts       |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Submitting a manuscript adds the _Author_ role to a person | Any large run of text in the system will be stored in the DB | Manuscripts will follow [this flowchart](https://github.com/AthenaKouKou/journal/blob/main/docs/Manuscript_FSM.jpg) |
| Users can edit and delete their own accounts | Journal title can be edited? (unsure what this entails) | Have a Dashboard to present all manuscripts |
| Assigning a _Refereee_ role when someone adds them to a manuscript | Only _Editors_ and _Managing Editors_ can edit texts | Only _Editors_ and _Managing Editors_ can see all manuscripts |
| Only _Editors_ and _Managing Editors_ can edit permissions of other accounts | | Users can only see manuscripts for which they are the auhor or referee |
| Only _Editors_ and _Managing Editors_ can see a list of all people | | |
| Advanced: Record a history of each user's interactions in the system | | |
